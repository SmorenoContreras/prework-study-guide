## Description

This Prework Study Guide was created as part of a learning excercise while I'm but a baby deer, fumbling around while learning to code.  
It's been very frustrating yet exciting.  This is a little culmination of the prework for this coding bootcamp.  
I am generally the user so this is an outline that has helped with learning experience.  
It's helped to get used to some general best practices, and to build some muscle memory for Git commands and syncing the git hub repo.
